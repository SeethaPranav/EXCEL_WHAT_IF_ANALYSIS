# EXCEL_WHAT_IF_ANALYSIS
This repository provides comprehensive resources and examples for understanding and implementing What-If Analysis in Excel.

As part of this challenge, I utilized a simple dataset of product sales to conduct two What-If Analyses. First, I created a Scenario Manager for the "High Sales" scenario, where the units sold for each product were significantly increased. This allowed me to evaluate the impact on total sales values and overall profitability.

Additionally, I performed a Goal Seek analysis for one of the products that was not achieving its profit target. Through this process, I determined the required number of units that needed to be sold to reach the desired profit level. This analysis provided valuable insights into optimizing sales strategies and ensuring that profit targets are met.
